# ChromBERT-tools: Utilities for ChromBERT-based regulatory analysis

> **ChromBERT** is a pre-trained deep learning model designed to capture genome-wide co-association patterns of ~1,000 transcription regulators and to learn context-specific transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) [ChromBERT](https://github.com/TongjiZhanglab/ChromBERT).  
> **ChromBERT-tools** is a lightweight companion library that wraps these capabilities into easy-to-use command-line and Python utilities.

**ChromBERT-tools v1.0 will be released on December 26, 2025**

  - Tool: `chrombert_embedding_cistromes`
- **TRN inference** – infer transcriptional regulatory networks over user-specified regions.  
  - Tool: `chrombert_inferring_trn`

### 2. Cell-specific representations

- **Cell-specific region embeddings** – generate region embeddings conditioned on user-provided cell-type–specific profiles.  
  - Tool: `chrombert_embedding_cell_regions`
- **Cell-specific gene embeddings** – generate gene embeddings conditioned on user-provided cell-type–specific profiles.  
  - Tool: `chrombert_embedding_cell_gene_tss`

  - Tool: `chrombert_inferring_cell_trn`


### 3. Cistrome imputation

- **Impute missing cistromes** – predict cistromes for regulators or contexts that lack direct ChIP-like assays.  
  - Tool: `chrombert_imputing_cistromes`

### 4. Dynamic analysis and driver regulator discovery

- **Cell-state transitions** – rank putative driver regulators underlying specific transitions between cell types.  
  - Tool: `chrombert_finding_driver_factors_in_cell_state_transition`
- **Functional region contrasts** – identify regulators whose context-specific embeddings best discriminate between two sets of functional regions.  
  - Tool: `chrombert_finding_driver_factors_in_functional_regions`
